        // Usage:
        // Attach this script to the object with the animator.
        // Add animation event at end of the animation clip.
        // Configure the animation event to call DisableAnimator.
        // Unity AnimationEvent can only call a function on the animator object.
        // The animator needs to be re-enabled before it will play.
        // For example, AnimationView.SetState re-enables an animator.
        // AnimationEvent uses SendMessage, which is over 100x times slower than a function call!
        // https://answers.unity.com/questions/243876/efficiency-of-sendmessage.html
        //
        // Remarks:
        // Useful to disable animation at the end of a clip.
        // Useful to speed up performance if animator update is a hotspot in the profiler.
        // Unfortunately Unity animations can be slow and take up processing time
        // even after the last keyframe.
        // Disabling all animators removes this cost from the profiler.
        // """Disable idle animations. Avoid design patterns where an animator sits in a loop setting a value to the same thing. There is considerable overhead for this technique, with no effect on the application. Instead, terminate the animation and restart when appropriate."""
